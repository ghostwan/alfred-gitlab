The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

### Upgrade notes
If you have already upgraded to MacOS 12.3 you will not be able to automatically upgrade.
Please download the latest released copy of the workflow from [releases](https://github.com/lukewaite/alfred-gitlab/releases) and re-install.

If you are not yet on 12.3, you can run `gl workflow:update` to update.

### Skipping 2.x
The PR with the fix for python3 came in tagged as 3.0.0. I'm going to skip straight to that tag so that anyone who's
upgraded to the fork in the meantime has the ability to pull updates in the future without having to "go back" to 2.x.
